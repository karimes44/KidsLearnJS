<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>Instruction</h2>
<p>Have you written a text in Google Docs, or MS Word, before?</p>

<p>With these tools you first write, say, your title, and then highlight the title, and select from the top toolbar, maybe that it should be bold and with a font size of 20pt. So you directly tell the computer how a particular word should be displayed.</p>

<p>Writing a text with HTML is a bit different...</p>

<p>With HTML, you put "tags" around everything you write to "mark-up" the text. There mark-ups tell the computer what this piece of text <em>is</em>, but not how to display it.</p>

<p>With another tool, called CSS, you tell the computer how text that belongs to a certain mark-up type should be displayed.</p>

<p>This has the advantage that you can write your text first, and then later think how to make it look pretty. Also, if you change your mind you can, for example change the appearance of <em>all</em> tags in the entire document with just one CSS instruction.</p>

<p>For a nice first look at HTML and CSS, please listen to the section on <b>Kahn Academy</b>:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<p>Now open the file <tt>HelloWorld.html</tt> in the text editor <b>Caret</b> and write your own text in the <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>. Try out some of the new tags you learned in the HTML section, and then change <tt>&lt;style&gt;</tt> content using what you learned in the CSS section.</p>
