<h1>15 Squares Puzzle Game with Images</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>The code for this version is pretty much the same as the version with the numbers. We just put images into the tiles in the same way we did in the <b>The Cow Flies Over The Moon</b> game:</p>
<pre>&lt;td id= "1" onclick='move( "1")' class="blk"&gt;&lt;img src="./img/LK_1.png"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</pre>

<p>We took a square image and cut it up into 16 smaller squares and saved each one with a different name in a sub-directory we called <code>img</code>. We added the tile id to the end of the file name. We used "Microsoft Paint" for that, but there are many other tools you can use.</p>
