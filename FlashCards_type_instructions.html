<h1>Flash Cards/Type</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The main difference between the <b>Flash Card</b> game and the <b>Flash Card/Type</b> version of the game is that now you can type in the answer, and, similar to the <b>Multiplication</b> game, it keeps track of how many you got right.</p>

<p>Let's just talk about what we changed between the two games:</p>

<h3><code>NewCard()</code></h3>

<p>We added two more lines to the code that writes the front of the flash card:</p>
<pre>
var FC = "&lt;div class='card front' &gt;" + FlashCards[i][0]; 
FC += "&lt;br/&gt;&lt;textarea id='A' rows='1' cols='20'&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;";
FC += "&lt;br/&gt;&lt;button type='button' onclick='FlipCard(" + i + ")'&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";
</pre>

<p>We added a text area, for you to type in the answer, and a <b>Submit</b> button &mdash; just as in the <b>Hallo YOU</b> game.<br/>

<h3>What is <code>FC += ...</code>?</h3>
<p>Can you guess? Right, it just short-hand for <code>FC = FC + ...</code></p>

<p>We also added the command:<br/>
<pre>document.getElementById("A").value = "";</pre>
<p>at the end of the <code>NewCard()</code> function. We need that to erase the answer you typed from the previous card...</code>

<h3><code>FlipCard()</code></h3>
<p>Here, we read what you typed, again similar to how we did it in the <code>Hallo YOU</code> game, then we check if what you typed is the same as what is on the back of the card with:</p>
<pre>if ( A == FlashCards[i][1] ) { ... }</pre>
<p>and keep track of your score in the same way we did in the <b>Multiplication</b> game.<p>
