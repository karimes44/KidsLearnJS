<h1>Billiards</h1>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The table is set-up for a game of Nine-Ball. You can find the instructions for Nine-Ball at:  <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-ball"> Wikipedia: Nine-ball Instructions</a></li>
 
 <li>To make a shot, just click where you want the cue-ball (the gray "0" one) to go.</li>
 
 <li>You can make the cue-ball go faster or slower by adjusting the slider bar.</li>
 
 <li>Did not like how your last shot turned out? Click <b>Restore</b> for another try at the same shot. The <b>Restore</b> button will appear as soon as all balls came to rest.</li>

 <li>Should you sink the cue-ball, you can click where you want it to re-appear.</li>
 
 <li>The program will evaluate if a shot was legal according to the rules mentioned in the first bullet point. If not the other player gets to take the next shots.</li>
 
 <li>The program also keeps track of howmany shots each player took and which balls the player sank.</li>
 </ul>
