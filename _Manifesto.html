<h1>What this is all about?</h1>

<h2>Creating your own games is fun!</h2>
<p>In this class we want to get you to look at computers and the Web a bit differently.</p>

<p>Don't think of apps and games as something you just download and play <br/>
&mdash; ... but as something you can build yourself!</p>

<p>You may think: <i>That is way too hard!</i><br/>
 &mdash; Guess what, it is not! ... let us show you how.</p>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________ -->
<h2>... <i>your OWN</i>, get it?</h2>
<p>There are many classes out there that teach you how to program, very nice ones too! They all try to make the learning easy and fun. Often, they do that by creating some kind of "safe environment", like a <i>digital sand box</i> in which you can learn and play in. That is great, but whatever you build in that digital sand box, <i>you can't take out</i>. <br/>
You can tell your friends or parents to come visit the digital sand box and see what you created there &mdash; but you can't send it to them... </p>

<p>We think, that if you can't take it out then it is not really yours. <br/>
&mdash; We want it to be yours!</p>

<p>We show you how you can build games and apps that you can share with any or all your friends and family simply by attaching them to an email &mdash; and they will be able to enjoy what you created simply by clicking on the attachment in the email, on whatever device they are using.<p>

<p>But also, if you don't want to share what you did with everybody or anybody  (<i>... maybe it's a secret project?</i>), you can do that too.  <br/>
&mdash; It is all up to <b>YOU</b>!</p>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________ -->
<h2><i>"The games in the class look a bit bland..."</i></h2>
<p>Guess you have a point there...</p>
<p>Think of them as pages in a digital coloring book. <br/>
&mdash; You can make them look just the way <i>you</i> like it!</p>

<p>Think of them as build from just a few Lego pieces. <br/>
&mdash; You can take them apart and put them together to create <i>your</i> game!</p></p>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________ -->
<h2>Why HTML/CSS/JavaScript?</h2>
<p>That is the programming language all Web browsers use, and Web browsers are on any device. Once you have a PC, Mac, or Chrome Book, old or new, a smart phone or a tablet &mdash; you are good to go! <br/>
Nothing extra to download or buy, and you are not locked into a certain Web site. You can even create or play with your games offline.</p>

<p>Also, the programming language you learn about here is the same that is used <i>everywhere</i> on the Web &mdash; it <b>IS</b> the language of the Web. <br/>
Therefore, what you learn will be useful for you later, whatever you do.</p>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________ -->
<h2>What about other programming languages?</h2>
<p>There are so many different programing languages... If you will want to become a programmer or engineer you will most certainly need to learn a few others, too.</p>

<p>But the basic ideas of all of them are pretty much the same. What you learn when you create your games and apps with HTML/CSS/JavaScript will also give you a big head start with other languages, such as Python, Java, or C++.</p>

<!-- _______________________________________________________________ -->
<h2><i>Self-contained?</i></h2>
<p>"Self-contained" &mdash; that word is a mouthful... what it means is that all our games and apps are organized such that everything fits into a single <code>.html</code> document. That's why you can email them to your friends and family just like that.</p>

<p>Often programmers put different parts of the game or app in different documents (or <i>files</i> as they are called). For example, they may put the HTML and CSS parts each in a separate file. The JavaScript parts may even come from several different files. That helps when you want to re-use them. For example, you could a load single CSS definition file in many different HTML files (actually we do just that for all the <i>Instruction</i> pages), or if you want to package  JavaScript functions into <i>libraries</i> for very big games <br/>
... but then it becomes more difficult to share the games with your friends and family.<br/>
&mdash; that's why we try to keep everything in just a single HTML file.</p>

<p>(Actually, there is one exception: if you want to include your own pictures in your games. Each of these pictures will have to be in its own file.)</p>
